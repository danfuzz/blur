Blur
====

### "I'd rather write shell scripts than Makefiles."

Blur is a very simple build system, with (practically speaking) no
dependencies.

"Blur" doesn't stand for anything, and it's certainly not a reference to
the tool's blazing fast speed. It's just a description of how
the stream of tears affects my vision whenever I contemplate having
to use Make... or do build system work in general.
